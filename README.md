<strong>*The Activity:*</strong>

1) Code the screenshot. 
    (Don’t worry about the export, sort, and definitely not the toggles between the different views or the click to         
    call/email/map an address functionality. We’re more concerned about the quality of your code.) 

2) Clicking on the drop down arrow should slide out that person's information. We'd like to see email address, phone, and physical address for each person. Feel free to use the same dummy information for each person.  We want to see how you tackle this as a *design* challenge. What does that wind up looking like?  

*Some key details:*

The font-family CSS stack is `proxima-nova,sans-serif`. Proxima Nova is part of Adobe Fonts, if you don't have access to Adobe Fonts please use Montserrat from Google Fonts. The icons are Font Awesome. (fontawesome.com)
 
Make it responsive! Max width is 940px (this is just one column on the page, fyi). Please do not use any existing libraries or frameworks other than CSS resets and jQuery for event binding, and adding and removing classes. We want to see your ability to code and problem solve from scratch. 

When you're finished (should take less than 3 hours), please put it online where we can view it, upload your source to Github, and send the links back to us.

<strong>My Steps to Solving:</strong>
1) First, I uploaded the screenshot into Photoshop. This allowed me to get the exact colors and dimensions of the content of the screenshot.
2) Break things down by classes to create a simple, responsive, and intuitive front-end project that shows my organization style with my code.
3) This project was done using strict HTML / CSS. There are many different ways and approaches to this, but since this project was moreso focused on the organization and  quality of the code, I decided to keep things very simple and clean. With more information and access to the backend or data, I would probably opt into using JavaScript to pull the data / contact information automatically.

<strong>Issues / Comments:</strong>

With more information, access, etc. I would have opted into doing something more 'automatic'. 

For example, the initials/contact images beside the contact name are just images pulled from the original image. 

However, in other instances, if I were to be working more with the backend and more time (this was to be completed in ~3 hours) I would use JavaScript and input the names as strings that could be split up using the first initial and last initial, which would make their 'initials card'. 

Another example would be the icons - I would have it automatically set up in a way such that if their email / phone number is available it would appear as blue, and 'inactive' icons would be grey. Again, this could be done in a more 'automatic' way using JavaScript, but as this projet was moreso about quality of code and less about the backend functionality, I just opted into manually setting them as the blue color.
